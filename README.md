 Public API Requests

General info
My project is a Public API Requests. I'm building an application for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other. I will grab information for 12 random employees and use their data to build a prototype for their directory, using the Random User Generator API. 

Extra Credit
Display color changed of employees' cards.
Gives the modal a previous and next functionality. 
Spent too much time trying to get the eventListener to happen for the extra credit, so at this point I chose to move on and will come back.

Status
Project is: finished
